# Holodeck B2B Signal Notification
This project is an example of a custom extension to the Holodeck B2B Core platform. It implements a _message delivery
method_ for ebMS Signal message units.
The ebMS data from the Signal messages is written to an XML document using the same structure as the ebMS header. A
simple XML schema definition is provided for "cleaner" generated code for XML processing.
As this delivery method is only able to process Signal message units it should only be used in One-Way P-Modes that are
used for sending User Messages.

## Installation
Copy the jar file into the `lib` directory of the Holodeck B2B installation **before** the server is started.

### Prerequisites
This extension has no specific requirements and can be installed in any Holodeck B2B version 2.0.0 or later running on
Java 7 or later.

### Configuration
Delivery methods are configured in the P-Mode.
To enable this signal delivery method set the `DeliveryMethod` element to `org.holodeckb2b.delivery.signals.file.SignalNotifier`.
The delivery method has two parameters:

1. _deliveryDirectory_ : should contain the path where the files containing the signal meta-data should be written to;
2. _includeReceiptContent_ : indicates whether the complete content of a _Receipt_ signal should be included in the output
or only the first child element. This is an optional parameter with default value _false_.

* create an issue related to the problem you want to fix or the function you want to add (good for traceability and cross-reference)
* fork the repository
* create a branch (optionally with the reference to the issue in the name)
* write your code
* commit incrementally with readable and detailed commit messages
* submit a pull-request against the master branch of this repository
